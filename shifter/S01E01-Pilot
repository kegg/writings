John Burke sat at his desk looking out the window. It was a typical day for the computer programmer. He turned his attention back to his work and continued on his project.

"John?" A female voice came from the open door.

He looked up. "Alice, yes. Come in. What can I do for you?"

Alice handed John a vanilla folder. "This just arrived for you."

John looked over the folder, his eyes grew as he read over the first page. "What on Earth?"

Alice shrugged "Something wrong?"

John ran his fingers through his dark black hair. "I'm not sure. I don't understand what this even means." He looked to Alice with a puzzled expression "I mean who would send me a letter that simply says 'Becareful what you wish for'? It doesn't make sense."

"Oh so it's a game of sorts." Alice said.

Burke shook his head. "Must everything be a game with you?"

Alice winked. "Well boss, that's just how it is. You never know..." Her voice trailed off as he vanished in thin air.

Alice screamed.

John blacked out as he vanished.

Ten minutes later he came to. Looking around he was still in his office seated at his desk. "What on earth?" Looking to the door Alice was gone. "Hello?"

He stood and headed towards the door.

The entire office was empty. No one was at their desks. Could the work day be over already? John walked to the front door of the building and exited.
