2 GB

Another thing to note regarding technology.

Years ago 20 MB was a tong of hard drive space for a computer.

My phone has 16 GB of external memory. Easily blasting that first computer out of the water. Crazy how that all works out. Of course now computers have terabyte drives and lots of other bells and whistles.

Evolution at work?

Considering it’s technology, I don’t doubt that.

But as humans get smarter technology will continue to grow and expand. Things that use to belong to the world of Science Fiction are quickly becoming a reality.

Funny with all of these enhancements there still isn’t a cure for the common cold or other more dangerous diseases.

Such a loss.
