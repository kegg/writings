Soda
====

Soda and I don't always get along. For a time I swear caffeine would make me sleepy.

Now it just keeps me awake and gives me heart burn. Go figure. I stil drink it though.

There could be worse things to be drinking. Of course there could be better things to be drinking also. Water for instance. Always a good choice.

Oh sugar, why do you have to taste so good?

Doesn't seem fair somedays. Makes one want to just stop drinking soda altogether.

But it's so darn yummy!

Oh well,l I'm sure I'll figure it out someday. Yep that I will.

Until then. Yum Yum Yum!
