The Fish
========

Ah yes, the fish is this big story.

With each telling that darn fish got bigger and bigger.

Who knew a goldfish could turn into a shark and eventually a whale. It was a midget goldfish to begin with. Yeah I don't believe it either.

But people love to tell their tall tales and whatnot. Some do it for attention. Others do it as a way to amuse themselves which can go back to the whole attention getting routine.

Still others are simply clueless to the fact they aren't telling the truth. To them the fish really was that big!

Then there are those who have lost it and just don't remember all the details anymore. Poor souls. Lost in a mind they once had full control over.

But as far as the fish story is concerned. You either go big or go home.
