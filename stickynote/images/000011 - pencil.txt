Number 2
========

The most widely known pencil to exist. Yes that's correct. Good ol' number 2.

Funny how it's become a standard. Not even sure what all that means. But hey it is what it is. Thanks to #2 we've been able to fill out scantron tests and celebrate our favorite band ACDC at the same time!

No it's not random or by chance this happened. It had to be by design. Yes and we owe it all to the number two pencil. Thank you dear pencil for making life that much more fun and enjoyable.
