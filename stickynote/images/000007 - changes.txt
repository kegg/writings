Changes
=======

Amazing how quickly times have changed over the years. People used to write letters. Yes on paper no less.

Now you just fire up a computer and send off a quick e-mail. One could think that we have become lazy due to all of the tech advances.

Or we have become more productive.

Either way things have become faster to communicate. what use to take days now only a matter of minutes or even seconds. One click of a mouse button and your message is sent.

With that much power at your fingertips people have the ability to hide behind anon faces and names. They can be rude without thinking. Snapping off a quick comment not caring what the person on the other side of the computer thinks.

Oh yes with something great also comes the worst in people.

Choose how you act wisely.
