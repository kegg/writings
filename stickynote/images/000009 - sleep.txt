Sleep
=====

That blissful moment when you lay down at the end of a long day and sleep.

Your mind can finally relax and allow you to get some much needed rest. Feels good doesn't it.

Of course one simply cannot look forward to going to sleep all the time. At the end of a difficult week is okay. But don't live just to sleep. There is so much more to life than that. So many experiences to take in.

They call it living for a reason.
