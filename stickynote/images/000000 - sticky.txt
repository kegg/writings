The Mighty Sticky Note
======================

You're sitting there perhaps at work, or at your home office. Just quietly minding your own business when your fingers have to do something.

You look to your keyboard, but don't feel like typing anything. Then you look to your legal pad.

Face it everyone has a legal pad.

You don't feel like writing on that either.

What's left?

The mighty [Sticky Note](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-it_note "Also known as a Post-It Note").

Oh yes, stickies. How fun are those things?

You can draw on them. Write on them. Do whatever you want and stick them places.

What more could one ask for?

Let the sticky note fun begin.
