Cinder Block Dude
=================

Why yes, that little fella sure is carrying a floating cinder block. Why wouldn't he be?

In other universes the balloon could be much heavier than a stone. A feather could weigh more than a house.

So here we have this little guy walking around with a floating block. For kicks.

Mostly because he has nothing else to do.

It's how he prefers to live his life.
