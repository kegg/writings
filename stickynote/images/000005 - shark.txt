Shark
=====

Poor shark.

Just out there minding his own business swimming along and enjoying the nice summer day.

His day of course gets interruped by people swimming by.

He didn't ask to be disturbed. The humans just decided to take over and invade his space.

Without asking I might add.

Of course he would have every right to defend himself. But no. That would be too easy.

So the shark gets taken out and put down. All because some bullies wanted to rule the playground.

Poor shark.

Hopefully he can get away to safer water before they come after him and humt him down.

Bad humans, bad bad humans.
