Fred
====

Meet Fred. He's your average person with pointy ears. Some think he's evil. Mostly due to the pointy ears of course.

He's not.

Fred is rather tame. He enjoys rock climbing, jogs on the beach, poking things with sticks. All the normal things that people do on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

Fred also enjoys smiling. As you can tell from this recent photo of him. No he's not covering anything up. He's just a happy guy. No really he is.

Favorite foods include marshmallows. If he could, Fred would eat all the marshmallows in the world and then some.

There is one slight problem with Fred. He doesn't ever know when to quit. You get him talking and he just won't shutup. He's a talker for sure.

So yes this is Fred. He's kinda smiley isn't he? Yeah that creeps me out like no other. But what can one do about it?

Just sit back and let him do his thing. He *is* only a piece of paper right?

Well a drawing on a piece of paper to be specific. Is there a specific about anything anymore?

Or are we all just out there like Fred? A smiling pointed head with no direction.

At least he's smiling. That has got to count for something.
