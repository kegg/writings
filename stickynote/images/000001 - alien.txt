The Alien
=========

Aliens do exist! This photographic evidence is proof. Cute little guy isn't he, with the cute little hands and the ear thingies.

Watch out, he may be cute... but deep down inside he's a monster waiting to attack. You never know what an alien like this will do.

One moment he's playing nice and letting you rub his head, the next kaboom. Total meltdown.

You can look but don't touch.

What monster lies beneath...

This little fella came to me one morning. I was sitting here minding my own business. He wanted directions on how to get back to his home planet. He didn't look like E.T. so I wasn't sure I could trust him. You never know who you can trust these days.

After more talking, and on his part scheming, it was agreed that I would help him in his quest.

Who knew that quest would last for five years! Oh wait, he did. He's the one that throught up the whole thing.

Searching high and low we looked and looked for his home planet. He never did say the name of his planet. Odd now that I think of it.

Five years of looking, and we finally came upon what was believed to be his. Oh yes we had found his home.

Who knew aliens lived in the Keys? I sure didn't!

So yep, he's back home in the Keys. Doing who knows what. Probably plotting and waiting Earth's destruction while basking in the sun.
