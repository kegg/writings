Balloon Animals
===============

There was a time when Balloon Animals were actual animals. Then others came and created Balloon Humans.

That's right, Balloon Humans. You read that correctly.

No one wanted Balloon Animals anymore, they wanted things that resembled them.

A smiley face, a happy existence. Until one day all of the Balloon Humans flew away far into the sky.

People tried to grab onto them to make sure they didn't leave, but it was too late.

As the Balloon Humans got higher and higher into the sky the popped one by one.

Finally they were free.

The people of the Earth mourned the loss of their friends. Funeral services were held. Helium Tanks were depleted.

The Balloon Humans were never heard from again.

Inanimate objects became the norm for Balloon artists. Swords, shields, flowers. This way the Humans could never feel loss again.
