Final Log Entry

First Officerâ€™s Log, Stardate Unknown

I have been in the Breen Prison Camp for over a month now along with my fellow officers of the Tripoli. I have been in solitary confinement for fifteen to twenty of those days. Today I was allowed, by the Vorta, to make this entry. I will be executed tomorrow.

This could be the final entry I will be making as First Officer of the starship Tripoli under the command of Captain Burke.

I do not dare say anything that might give the Breen or the Dominion information that might aid them in their fight against the Federation, so with my words being cut short, I can only say the following to my fellow Tripoli officers: It has been an honor serving aboard the Tripoli and for Starfleet. I have never found another group that I would ever want to be affilated with, keep your heads held high and give the Dominion what they deserve.
